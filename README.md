This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling for cases where a requested resource is not found.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version, which includes proper 404 status code responses for missing users.  This is important for maintaining API consistency and providing informative error messages to clients.
